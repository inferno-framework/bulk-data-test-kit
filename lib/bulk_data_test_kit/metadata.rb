    description <<~DESCRIPTION
      The Bulk Data Access Test Kit validates the conformance of a server
      implementation to a specified version of the
      [Bulk Data Access Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/).
      This Test Kit currently includes tests for
      [STU1](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/STU1.0.1/) and
      [STU2](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/STU2/) versions of this
      implementation guide.

      <!-- break -->

      This test kit is split into three different types of bulk data export:

      - All Patients: FHIR Operation to obtain a detailed set of FHIR resources
        of diverse resource types pertaining to all patients
      - Group of Patients: FHIR Operation to obtain a detailed set of FHIR
        resources of diverse resource types pertaining to all members of a specified
        Group
      - System Level Export: FHIR Operation to export data from a FHIR server,
        whether or not it is associated with a patient

      The Bulk Data Access Test Kit is built using the
      [Inferno Framework](https://inferno-framework.github.io/). The Inferno
      Framework is designed for reuse and aims to make it easier to build test
      kits for any FHIR-based data exchange.
