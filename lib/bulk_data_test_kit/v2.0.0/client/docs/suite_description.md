The Bulk Data Access v2.0.0 Client test suite validates the conformance of a client
to the [FHIR Bulk Data Access IG STU2](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/STU2).

## Scope

These tests are a **DRAFT** intended to allow implementers to perform
preliminary checks of their systems against the requirements stated for Bulk Data client actors
and [provide feedback](https://github.com/inferno-framework/bulk-data-test-kit/issues)
on the tests. Future versions of these tests may verify other
requirements and may change the test verification logic.
